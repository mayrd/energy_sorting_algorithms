# Energy Consumption of Common Sorting Algorithms

This repository contains code and data sets in line with the research study on "Energy Consumption of Common Sorting Algorithms".
It includes the written pager as .pdf, the code for the idle consumption evaluation as well as the code for the sorting consumption evaluation.

In datasets/ the evaluation data is published for all four sorting algorithms executed on an Arduino UNO R3 (UNO) and an Arduino Nano ESP32 (ESP32).
